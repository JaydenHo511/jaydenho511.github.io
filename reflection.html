        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <h4> Python turned out to share many similarities with Pyret, something which was unexpected for me. <br>
            Having similarities between languages made the first few lessons go by smoothly.<br> However, having minute differences made it hard, 
            as I had some of these differences memorized based on Pyret instead of Python.<br> <br>In the end, I spent so much time with little things
            that I ended up not giving myself enough time for Hangman, which I had planned to do as an artifact for this project. <br>
            I followed a tutorial which was rather fast-paced and didn't fully understand the concepts for the game. <br>
            Time constraints also played a part, as there were some parts of the code that I didn't understand due to not learning it in time. <br>
            <br> Next time I take on a project like this, I need to work on my time management by knowing my priorities instead of following the lesson plans,<br>
            especially since I am on a strict schedule instead of an open schedule like the PY4E lesson were designed for. <Br>
            I also feel that I may have been too ambitious when planning and doing to proposal for this project, <br>
            selecting something that requires a lot of work without considering my other classes and workload.
